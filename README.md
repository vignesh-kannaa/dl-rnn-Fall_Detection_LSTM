Fall detection using LSTM
The most recent research by  [Mohammad Taufeeque et al. (2021)](https://www.spiedigitallibrary.org/conference-proceedings-of-spie/11601/2580700/Multi-camera-multi-person-and-real-time-fall-detection-using/10.1117/12.2580700.full?SSO=1) shows that deep learning can solve complicated problems. In order to identify falls, a vital activity that might potentially save lives, especially among the senior population, their suggested solution makes use of multi-camera, multi-person video data. The system precisely and successfully recognises falls with a remarkable precision and recall rate by utilising an LSTM network and many cameras to get insights into the temporal dynamics of the picture. A noteworthy achievement of the system is a low false alarm rate of 0.12 per hour, highlighting its potential in real-world circumstances. The system has some restrictions and potential problems that must be considered, despite its novel approach.In this blog, we will explore the details of this method, its benefits, and its drawbacks, and discuss its potential applications in the field of deep learning.

The paper presents an innovative method that achieves a remarkable degree of precision in detecting falls while offering a thorough explanation of the applied methodology. Furthermore, the authors evaluate the effectiveness of their system on two distinct datasets, further underscoring the reliability of their approach. The study also sheds light on the potential avenues for future research in this domain, such as the creation of a multi-camera video dataset that more accurately represents fall conditions and probabilities. This paper offers valuable insights into the application of multi-camera systems for fall detection and can serve as a useful resource for researchers and practitioners in this field.

### **OpenPifPaf**

In this paper, the authors use the OpenPifPaf algorithm for human pose estimation. OpenPifPaf is a state-of-the-art algorithm for estimating human poses in images and videos. It uses a multi-task learning approach to estimate both the keypoints of a person's body and their association with other people in the scene.

At this stage, the videos captured by each camera are utilized as input. These videos are analyzed as a series of images, with each frame processed sequentially. The key benefit of this approach is that it offers superior performance on low-resolution images and requires lower hardware specifications compared to other state-of-the-art algorithms. For each frame obtained from each camera, a list of keypoint sets that represent the position of joints for a single person is generated.

### **LSTM**

The use of LSTM networks in fall detection systems has been gaining popularity due to their ability to handle sequential data effectively. The LSTM layer can process input data over time and capture long-term dependencies, which is particularly useful in detecting falls.
One of the main advantages of using LSTM networks is their ability to handle variable-length sequences. This means that the fall detection system can process video data of different lengths without any preprocessing steps. Furthermore, the use of LSTM networks can improve the accuracy of the system by capturing subtle temporal dependencies and patterns in the data.The use of LSTM networks in fall detection systems is a promising technique that can improve the accuracy and efficiency of these systems. However, as with any deep learning approach, there are limitations and potential issues that need to be taken into consideration, which we will explore later in this blog.

This method uses long short-term memory (LSTM) network to analyze video data from multiple cameras simultaneously.The LSTM network is trained on human pose estimation data obtained by openpifpaf library to detect falls accurately. To represent human poses, the authors use an "inverted pendulum model" consisting of five keypoints: head, neck, buttocks, left knee, and right knee. This model is used to track the movement of each person in the video and estimate their pose accurately.The output of the LSTM layer is a probability value that indicates the likelihood of a fall occurrence in the input sequence. The output is then passed through a fully connected layer, which produces a single output value indicating the probability of a fall occurrence. The final output value can be thresholded to make a binary decision on whether a fall has occurred or not. The system can take into account how a person's pose changes over time and use this information to make more accurate predictions about whether a fall has occurred. By using an LSTM network and an inverted pendulum model to analyze human poses, they are able to achieve high accuracy in detecting falls even in multi-person scenarios.
